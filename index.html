  <div id="Personal-Life"><h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>Easley had always loved dressing up. She wore stockings and heels almost
      everyday in college. Although there were no dress code in her work department,
      wearing pants as a woman during that time was still not normalized.
      However, she was one of the first to wear pants to work in the 1970s after
      talking to her supervisor about it. </p></div>
